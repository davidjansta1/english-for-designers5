This presentation should have been about something totally different. Back then I made a brief presentation about how I mostly overcame my caffeine addiction, but since then something has totally changed. I slowly started to drink it a little bit more and now I'm on 3x coffees a day with some tea.

I could call it a day and just read you my previous story, but no. Instead of how to overcome caffeine addiction, I will call it how I plan to overcome my caffeine addiction. If you have a problem with caffeine, it's fine to some extent, but I was drinking way too much. Like amount, that was actually extremely dangerous sometimes.

Usually it was 2 to 3 times more than maximum recommended dose per day. Not a good thing for my health. Yeah, I know. And trust me, I tried to change it many times, but I was just changing one addiction to the other.  I just have this extreme problem with not doing anything that kind of harms me I guests.

Like, always had to be addicted to something like caffeine. Before caffeine it was nicotine and I don't know. And if I think about it, can I imagine life without drinking anything with,  a caffeine? Yeah, sure. Yes, but it's not necessary. We know caffeine is kind of healthy for us to some extent, but higher amount is just extremely unhealthy.

So I will tell you things that you can do to drink caffeine the right way. Not like avoid it altogether, but you can know how it works and if you can benefit from it or not. I made a huge research from Andrew Huberman.

He's a scientist who teaches this kind of stuff. And yeah, I trust his information way more than just some basic YouTube video facts channels.

With videos titled like 10 facts about coffee. He's a real scientist. With extremely detailed research and I actually learned this a year ago because caffeine was a big thing for me. So I wanted to use it the right way. But I couldn't do the one and probably the most important thing right and that's drinking just right amount and not overdo it. So caffeine is a reinforcer.  It means that if it's in some drinks and food, we like tend to like these things more. It's not just a stimulant. Yeah, more than 90% of people consume caffeine.

Some people just don't even know it. And yeah, caffeine has a lot of benefits. And this part will be probably a big cope for me. Because yeah, it's just a cope for me to list reason to drink it. But yeah, just keep this in mind. It has a neoprotective effect, which means it can increase our focus, motivation and drive to do things.

It can reduce anxiety, but it's not like clear if it's direct or indirect. And sure, uh, if you only drink the right amount and not overdo it. It also improves reaction time. We can also learn better, because we have better memory. While drinking it. It also has dopamine receptors in the reward pathway, which means that what would feel good, feels even better.

And yeah, uh, so how to drink it the right way? Maximum is 3mg/kg, but right amount is like 1-3mg/kg. That means I weight around 80 kilograms, so I should drink  80-240mg. Um, and that's like 1-3 small coffees. Another interesting thing he mentioned was delaying caffeine intake to 90-120 minutes after you wake up.

Uh, that's because of some more complicated things like adenosine etc. But I don't want to explain it here. And why to avoid it in the early morning? Because this way we can avoid that afternoon crash. Then, another thing he mentioned is drinking it with water. Maybe with a small pitch of salt. Like, I don't know, uh, I don't want to put salt into my drinks.

But it's something that, that is recommended, maybe. Yeah. I know that, um, it's common to add salt to some drinks. Like, for example, in Monster, I remember these. In sugarfree versions, there were like, uh, 0, 0, 0, 0. And then there was like. 0,2mg of sugar or something like that. Yeah. And yeah, um, back to how to use caffeine.

Avoid it 12 hours before sleep. For me, almost impossible, but yeah, I'm putting it here just like fact, but do whatever. Also abstinence from caffeine increases its effects. And the same thing to experience these benefits, you have to purposely try to not drink it, which could be really frustrating to some of us.

![yeah2](https://github.com/davidjansta1/english-for-designers5/assets/165008882/e9cf5187-9634-49b0-8c0b-ef4a589dc0d7)

Yeah. And he also mentioned some other facts, but I don't want to be too boring. So now we know his benefits and how to use it properly. Good. Um, let's talk about how to reduce it or why to reduce it. Because there's one thing that I realized and I mentioned in a previous presentation. It's the reason why we are trying to overcome our addiction and not how to overcome our addiction.

It's something extremely beneficial because anytime I had a clear reason why to end it, I ended it or reduced it. Uh, I was scared of my health. I was too much tired or something like that. When there were those negative effects, it was way easier for me. And it's not just about drinking more, it's about, it's about that good feeling I crave from it and those benefits.

And I just thought that drinking more leaded to that buzz feeling, and drinking less leaded to bad feelings. So, how to work with these why questions? Let me talk to myself, right now. So you will understand. Why I want to end it? I asked myself. I don't want to be dead because of it and have a heart attack. I don't want to be dependent on it and drink it all the time.

I don't want to have these mood swings. I want to be healthy. I want to save some money. And yeah, I don't know. Why I don't want to end it? I will feel worse. It gives me this energy and I won't have it. If I won't drink it. And yeah with these facts I mentioned I could think like this: I will feel worse for a few weeks. But I could still drink it. And if I overcome those few weeks, I will feel way better and I could still drink it.

I just need to reduce it. And it will give me way more buzz and I won't have to drink it all the time. Be scared of heart attack. I won't have these mood swings, etc. What I did was I actually defined my WHY. WHY do I want to end it? Because before I wanted to  end it because I was scared of heart attack, but eventually it led to forgetting it and drinking it again like anything. But I probably needed to see these benefits and negatives. Actually clearly see and visualize what could happen if I won't overcome this habit. And then take action. And I could tell you that I overcame it and give you advice to overcome it as well. But no. Like it's not a simple solution. Theory could be great. But at the end day, It's uncomfortable to overcome it.

But looking back in life, whenever I was successful with reduction of caffeine or anything else, I always had a clear reason why to reduce it. Now I drink 1-3 coffees a day. So I don't have a real reason why to end it. And I don't even feel like not drinking it because I know it gives me this buzz.

So that's why I'm not even trying to avoid it. But back then when I was truly addicted to it, and it was dangerous, I had way bigger reason why to end it. Because before it was here and now it's here. So, I can't even be mad at myself to drinking it. And, yeah. This whole talk is just one big cope.

I'm just coping about why it's okay to drink it. And, yeah, I know. Just let me cope. But I also think that this definition of WHY could be kind of decent advice. And I heard it many times that we should ask WHY it's just not something I came up from scratch. I think it's kind of simple and basic advice, I guess.

But it works. Looking back, I think it's extremely beneficial thing. So we can probably use the WHY method to anything in life. I will use it as well. Just think about why we want to change something. Overcome something. Achieve something. Define it extremely clearly. And the more detail, the better.
